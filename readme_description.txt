Neonsyncmotion is a Python program that captures your body in real-time using a webcam and generates a dynamic 3D model of your skeleton. The program visualizes your movements live in a 3D space, giving you an interactive representation of your body posture and motion.

This project is perfect for anyone interested in motion tracking, fitness analysis, animation, or just experimenting with computer vision and 3D visualization in Python.

The core of the program uses computer vision to detect body joints and matplotlib to render a 3D skeleton, updating in real-time as you move. Itâ€™s lightweight, easy to run, and provides a clear view of body mechanics in a visually engaging way.
